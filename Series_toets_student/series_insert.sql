He has variously been described as a \"short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man\" (by Elaine Benes and Costanza himself), \"weak, spineless, man of temptations\" (by Cosmo Kramer), and \"Lord of the Idiots\" (by Costanza himself). George and Jerry were junior high school friends (although in \"The Betrayal\", Season 9, Episode 8, George says the two have been friends since fourth grade) and remained friends afterwards.[1][2] He is friends with Jerry Seinfeld, Cosmo Kramer, and Elaine Benes. George appears in every episode except \"The Pen\" (third season).\r\n\r\nThe character was originally based on Seinfeld co-creator Larry David but is surnamed after Jerry Seinfeld\'s real-life New York friend, Michael Costanza.

(2, 'Jerry Seinfeld', 'jerry.jpg', 'm', 1976, 950000000, 'Jerome Allen Seinfeld (/ˈsaɪnfɛld/ SYNE-feld; born April 29, 1954)[2] is an American comedian, actor, writer, producer, and director. He is known for playing a semi-fictionalized version of himself in the sitcom Seinfeld, which he created and wrote with Larry David. The show aired on NBC from 1989 until 1998, becoming one of the most acclaimed and popular sitcoms of all-time. As a stand-up comedian, Seinfeld specializes in observational comedy. In 2005, Comedy Central named Seinfeld the \"12th Greatest Stand-up Comedian of All Time\".[3]\r\n\r\nSeinfeld produced, co-wrote and starred in the 2007 film Bee Movie. In 2010, he premiered a reality series called The Marriage Ref, which aired for two seasons on NBC. Seinfeld is the creator and host of the series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee on Netflix.

(3, 'Cosmo Kramer', 'cosmo.jpg', 'm', 1979, 45000000, 'Cosmo Kramer, usually referred to as simply \"Kramer\", is a fictional character on the American television sitcom Seinfeld (1989–1998), played by Michael Richards.\r\n\r\nThe character is loosely based on comedian Kenny Kramer, Larry David\'s ex-neighbor across the hall. Kramer is the friend and neighbor of main character Jerry, residing in Apartment 5B, and is friends with George and Elaine. Of the series\' four central characters, only Kramer has no visible means of support; what few jobs he holds seem to be nothing more than larks.\r\n\r\nA lovable rogue, his trademarks include his upright hairstyle and vintage wardrobe, whose combination led Elaine to characterize him as a \"hipster doofus\";[1] his taste in fresh fruit; love of occasional smoking, Cuban cigars in particular; bursts through Jerry\'s apartment door without even bothering to knock first; frequent pratfalls and penchant for nonsensical, percussive outbursts of noise to indicate skepticism, agreement, irritation and a variety of other feelings. He has been described as \"an extraordinary cross between Eraserhead and Herman Munster\".[2] Kramer appeared in all but two episodes: \"The Chinese Restaurant\" and \"The Pen\", in the second and third seasons, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\", the pilot episode of Seinfeld, Kramer was originally called \"Kessler\" to prevent legal issues since it was based on Larry David\'s real-life next-door neighbor Kenny Kramer. Kenny apparently liked Seinfeld and permitted Larry David, who was the writer of Seinfeld from seasons 1–7, to use \"Kramer\" as Kessler\'s name. Beginning with The Stake Out, the character\'s name was changed to Kramer.[3]', 1),

Although he is a born loser who constantly laments his lot in life, he nevertheless stands by his family, displaying wit, self-sacrifice and resilience in times of crisis. He and his wife, Peg, were rated the 59th best characters on television by Bravo.[2] In a 2016 interview Ed O\'Neill said that he based his interpretation of Al Bundy on one of his uncles.', 3),

He was born in Denver, Colorado to his parents William Winger and Doreen Winger née Fitzgerald .

She is the daughter of a Jewish mother and an Episcopalian father. Her parents divorced and she, along with her brother Anthony, were raised by their mother. At a very young age, Annie\'s mother pushed her hard to succeed academically. In her teens, she attended Riverside High School along with her then crush Troy Barnes. She ended up losing her college scholarship (and her virginity) and dropped out of high school due to an addiction to Adderall. Her drug abuse led to a nervous breakdown that culminated in her jumping through a plate glass window and suffering severe injuries. Her mother wanted to ignore the incident, but Annie chose to confront the addiction and go to rehab. As a result, Annie became estranged from her family and eventually moved out. She began attending Greendale Community College at the age of 18, and it\'s hinted that one of the main reasons is because Troy was going there. During her time at college she became close friends with him and their Spanish study group. After four years, she graduated and ironically got a job with a pharmaceutical company.

This job came to an end after an anonymous source revealed to Dean Pelton that he faked his teaching credentials. Chang was immediately fired but was allowed to enroll at the school as a music student with hopes of also earning a legitimate teaching degree. However, his personal life took a turn for the worse when he and his wife got divorced. This was due to him having gotten roofied and having an affair with another student at a Halloween party. He was kicked out and after a brief stay at Jeff Wingers apartment, eventually took up residence in the Greendale ventilation system. Dean Pelton learned about his situation and hired him to be a campus security guard. Chang grew mentally unstable during this time and used his job to stage a coup d\'état and took over the school. After his \"regime\" came to an end, he returned to the school months later claiming to have amnesia. He was gradually accepted back and Shirley even employed him at her sandwich shop. Ultimately, he eventually dropped the ruse, went to jail for his crimes, and was put in a work-release program employed at Greendale as a math teacher.

She cites her laziness as family tradition, getting upset with Kelly when she gets a job. She claims that Wanker women never work, and in old pioneer days, \"Wanker women were getting their hair done while Wanker men got theirs scalped.\" During the day, she likes to watch daytime talk shows, sit on the living room couch, and eat copious amounts of ice-cream BonBons (without ever gaining weight). Peg is a redhead (brunette in the first two seasons) with a bouffant hairdo and she usually wears combinations of modern-day 1980/1990s and dated 1960s-styled fashions with skin tight Spandex pants and shirts, and stiletto heels, which make her walk in a unique way. Peg smoked cigarettes in early episodes but then quit. Her favorite TV shows are Oprah and Donahue, but she also enjoys watching the Shop at Home Network. Peg continually squanders what little money Al makes on extravagant spending sprees: everything from expensive clothes to useless trinkets, even stealing from her children to get extra cash.\r\n\r\nPeg and Al married in 1971. Late in the first season she says she married Al on a dare, although this may have been just a sarcastic comment. In the fourth season it was revealed that she did not actually graduate from high school, failing to meet a half-credit in home economics. She later returned to school, earning her diploma, but only by stealing Kelly\'s final exam, and tricking Kelly into going to summer school.', NULL),

But for a brief time, she was demoted to drive-up window teller as punishment for approving a loan Al could not repay (in fact the purpose was to make Al able to repay a previous loan approved by Steve, but Al instead turned this loan into his \"shoe hotline\" project as well, and lost it too). She won back her old job after frugging on her boss\'s desk for 20 minutes, clad only in a slip, while the other drive-up window tellers tossed quarters at her.
